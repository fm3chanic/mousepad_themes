## fm3chanic Themes for Mousepad

This repository contains all color themes for the Mousepad plain-text editor I've created so far.<br> 
It is the text editor which comes with the XFCE4 desktop environment for Linux.

Themes which have been created during my project of color theming Vtubers are in the directory "vtuber_project". The directory "other" contains all color themes which where created outside of the project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that all color themes have been originally created for Notepad++, which has the tendency to show colors lighter as they are in other applications. Therefore it might occur that the color theme is a bit on the darker side.

### Installation:

Copy the theme file to `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-4/styles` and restart the application.<br>
The theme should now be selectable in your preferences or directly via *"View"*.

> [!NOTE]
> It might be necessary to create the directory first as `/gtksourceview-4/styles` might be missing in `~/.local/share`.
> Depending on the version and package source the application still might use `/gtksourceview-3.0/styles` instead. 
> You can check `/usr/share/` and source for application base themes, depending whether they are stored `/usr/share/gtksourceview-4/` or `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/` you should create the according local directory.

### Contribution:

If you want to help maintaining the themes, please use colors from the according color scheme. You can find the scheme files in the repo linked above.
